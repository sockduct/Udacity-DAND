# [DAND](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) Project 6 - Explore and Summarize Data

## Project Purpose and Notes
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

This project uses ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, and the scales packages as well as a R Markdown "notebook" to analyze a data set and communicate findings.  The data set is provided by Udacity.

This project was created and tested on Windows 10 64bit using R 3.5.1 with the following libraries:
* dplyr 0.7.6
* ggplot2 2.2.1
* lubridate 1.7.4
* scales 0.5.0
In addition, the use of RStudio is strongly recommended.  Version 1.1.453 was used to create and run the R Markdown "notebook" along with:
* knitr 1.2.0

## Installation and Requirements
* Install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
    * Note: R v3.5 or later recommended
* Install dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, and scales
* Download the Udacity data set
* Clone [this repo](https://github.com/sockduct/Udacity-DAND)
* Open the rmd file in RStudio
* Run or "re-knit" the rmd file from RStudio

## Project Requirements
* Using the provided project template RMD file, perform an analysis on the selected data set
  * A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data
  * A final plots and summary section at the end
  * A final reflection session capturing struggles, successes, and future ideas about the analysis of the data set

## Resource Attribution
* The following resources were used in coming up with the solution for this project:
    * StackOverflow
    * ggplot2 documentation/web site
    * knitr documentation/wiki
    * RStudio documentation and references on R Markdown and knitr options
    * Referenced many sections from "The Art of R Programming"
