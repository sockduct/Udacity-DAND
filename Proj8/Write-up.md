# [Project 8 - Create a Tableau Story](https://github.com/sockduct/Udacity-DAND/tree/master/Proj8) Write-up

## [Tableau Public Workbook - US Flight Stats, Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/james.small#!/vizhome/USFlightStats/USFlightsStory)

## Summary
This public Tableau story showcases US flights in a nutshell for 2008.  Beginning with flight destinations, then flight volumes, followed by flight cancellations and diversions, and ending with flight delays.  Each section allows filtering, and highlighting is used where it makes sense.  For each view, a brief description is provided.

## Design
* __Design:__ explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

The story begins with a map.  This clearly shows where people travel to within the US.  The map is interactive allowing the user to highlight various airports while revealing the airport code.  The viewer may also cycle through the months of the year to see how travel patterns change.  Continuing with each view (dashboard), filtering and highlighting are incorporated to allow and encourage exploration of the presented information.  Color is used sparingly, only added to the cancellation and delay views to highlight the different types of cancellation/delay causes.


## Feedback
* __Feedback:__ include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
