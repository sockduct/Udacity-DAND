# [DAND](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) Project 8 - Create a Tableau Story

## Project Purpose and Notes
Create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. The work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

This project was created and tested on Windows 10 64bit using Tableau 2018.2.0, 64bit, Public Edition

  * __Design:__ explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
  * __Feedback:__ include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
  * __Resources:__ list any sources you consulted to create your visualization
