# [DAND](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) Project 3 - Investigate a Dataset

## Project Purpose and Notes
This project uses NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze a dataset and communicate findings.  A dataset curated by Udacity will be utilized.

This project was created and tested on Windows 7 64bit using Python 3.6.4 32bit, NumPy 1.13.3, Pandas 0.22.0, Matplotlib 2.1.1, Jupyter 1.0.0, IPykernel 4.8.2, IPython 6.2.1, Jupyter-client 5.2.2, Jupyter-core 4.4.0, IPywidgets 7.1.2, nbformat 4.4.0, traitlets 4.3.2, widgetsnbextension 3.1.4, notebook 5.4.0, Jupyter-console 5.2.0, nbconvert 5.3.1

## Installation and Requirements
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Note 1: Due to the features used, Python v3.6 or later is required
* Install NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlilb, and Jupyter Notebook
* Download the Udacity curated TMDb movie data
* Clone [this repo](https://github.com/sockduct/Udacity-DAND)
* From the repo's Proj3 directory, run:  `jupyter notebook`
* From Jupyter, open `Project 3 - Investigate TMDb.ipynb`

## Project Requirements
* Using the selected dataset (TMDB movie data), perform an analysis using descriptive statistics
* Choosen questions to explore:
  * Overall statistics from movie titles in dataset:
    * Most popular films?
    * Highest budget films?
    * Highest revenue films?
    * Highest margin films?
    * Most successful directors?
    * Most popular genres?
    * Popularity of genres over time?
    * Most successful production companies?
    * Most popular actors/actresses?
  * What kinds of properties are associated with high revenue movies? (dependent variable)
    * directors, genres, production companies, cast (features with multiple values - independent variables)
    * runtime, budget, release month (features with single value - independent variables)
 * Analysis will be performed and documented in a Jupyter Notebook

## Project Solution Documents
